# **FP1 \- Proposal for Critique**

## Idea Sketches

### *Music Beatmaker*

![beatmaker sketch](final-project/images/BeatmakerSketch.png)

Add a few sentences about your design. Briefly state the motivation of each project idea. Example questions to answer:

* What is the basic idea of your final project? (1-2 sentences)  

  The main purpose of this idea is engage users through an interactive interface that allows for real-time music manipulation, making music creation accessible. It would serve as a learning tool for users interested in understanding music composition and arrangement without needed experience.

* How do you plan to make your design interactive and engaging?  

Within this design, I hope to show users how creativity and personal expression can be channeled through direct manipulation of audio. Users get to interact with this design by arranging loops of audio tracks and listen to them in isolation as well. 

* How do you plan to make your design accessible? 

I plan to use audio cues to help users understand changes they’re making in real-time, as well as label items clearly as to not require sight. I also plan to include tooltips and short text explanations or tutorials that guide users through composition concepts in simple terms. I also plan to include high-contrast themes for better readability.


* What information do you specifically want to convey and include on your website?

I hope to include an overview of the tool and its purpose, as well as the interactive elements themselves, and options to share and export their audio tool. 


### *Women's Cycle HeatMap*

![womens cycle image](final-project/images/WomensCycleHeatmapSketch.png)

Add a few sentences about your design. Briefly state the motivation of each project idea. Example questions to answer:

* What is the basic idea of your final project? (1-2 sentences) 

For this project, I would create a clear and intuitive visual representation of the different phases of the menstrual cycle (e.g., menstrual, follicular, ovulatory, luteal), and help users track changes in bodies and moods. I hope to take personalized data and provide personalized insights based on the user's data, such as predicting when certain symptoms may occur or suggesting lifestyle adjustments. 

* How do you plan to make your design interactive and engaging?  

Within this design, I plan to make it engaging by having user's input their own data and interact with a visual that includes a heatmap which indicates the fluctuations of moods in accordance to their cycle. 

* How do you plan to make your design accessible? 

I plan to represent each phase of the cycle (menstrual, follicular, ovulatory, luteal) with distinct colors, ensuring each meets color contrast standards. I want to include clear text labels for each phase, along with descriptions of what each phase means and its typical symptoms.

* What information do you specifically want to convey and include on your website?

I hope to include information regarding the menstrual phases in general, as well as a calendar, a heatmap for mood, and reccomendations for food/exercise. I wish to convey that information such as this should be accessible without a paywall.

…

### *Data Visualizations with Tangible Comparisons*

![Data Viz Sketch](final-project/images/DataVisualizationSketch.png)

Add a few sentences about your design. Briefly state the motivation of each project idea. Example questions to answer:

* What is the basic idea of your final project? (1-2 sentences) 

For this idea, I hope to transform abstract or hard-to-understand data into relatable, easy-to-digest information through visual and tangible comparisons. I believe that when users can visualize data in a tangible way, they are better equipped to make decisions, whether related to personal choices (ex sustainability, when understanding trash waste in more tangible terms). My goal would be to break down data in a way that is understandable to non-experts by using familiar visuals and evoke an emotional response from users to help them analyze data better.

* How do you plan to make your design interactive and engaging?  

To make my design interactive and engaging, I plan to incorporate dynamic visualizations that allow users to manipulate data sets and explore various scenrarios that I have hard coded. Users can interact with the visual elements of the data, such as sliders or graphs, to make the data exploration more immersive.

* How do you plan to make your design accessible? 

To ensure accessibility, I will use clear, high-contrast visuals and provide alternative text descriptions for all visual elements. 

* What information do you specifically want to convey and include on your website?

I will include visual comparisons with data sets. I would also include educational resources and guides will be provided to help users learn how to interpret visual data and apply insights to their daily lives.


## Feedback Summary

The feedback I received highlighted several key areas for improvement in my project For the Music Sequencer/Beatmaker, I was advised that iterative programming is key, and that managing the scope of this project could be done by listing all  of the features and separate them into "must-haves" and "nice-to-haves.” I was also advised to produce my own sounds for the beatmaker, adding a personal touch to the tool. I was also urged to consider aspects of accessibility knowing that I am dealing with an audio element. This could involve incorporating features such as visual indicators for sound levels or alternative input methods for users with hearing impairments.

For the Women’s Health Cycle Heatmap, I was advised to prioritize usability and that I do not need to handle real personal data for this project, which alleviated my privacy concerns. Additionally, I received feedback suggesting that this feature could be beneficial for planning lifestyle changes, meals, and exercise routines ahead of time in alignment with a woman’s menstrual cycle changes. I could also explore integrating personalized notifications or reminders that prompt users to adjust their plans based on their cycle phases to increase usability. 

For the Data Visualizations with Tangible Comparison, I was cautioned that allowing users to input their own statistics to create relatable visualizations may be overly ambitious and could divert attention from usability. Instead, I could focus on providing pre-populated data sets that users can interact with to generate insights without overwhelming them and overwhelming myself with the complexity. 

Overall, I received the most supportive feedback towards the idea of the Music Sequencer, as it resonated with my vision of creating an interactive platform that empowers users to express their creativity through music. The suggestions on iterative programming and sound production emphasized the project's potential for personalization, which would make it more engaging.


## Feedback Digestion

The feedback I received was incredibly helpful and pointed out some key areas to improve my projects. For the Music Sequencer/Beatmaker, the emphasis on iterative programming really stood out to me. I plan to create a detailed list of features divided into "must-haves" and "nice-to-haves," which will keep me focused on the essentials. I will have to figure out whether I want users to arrange the sounds themselves, choose sounds, create rhythms, etc. The idea of producing my own sounds is also exciting; it adds a personal touch that can make the experience feel more engaging and unique. For the Data Visualizations with Tangible Comparison, I realized that allowing users to input their own statistics could complicate things unnecessarily, but also would have personally loved to interact with that feature. For the sake of not complicating the scope further, I would hard code pre populated data sets.  I feel most compelled to work with the beatmaker because of how personal it is and how it allows for me to share a creative hobby of mine with others thru an accessible manner.
